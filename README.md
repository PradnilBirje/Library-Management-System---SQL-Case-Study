# Library-Management-System---SQL-Case-Study
This project focuses on designing and analyzing a library management system using SQL. 
The system is built on a well-structured database schema consisting of six tables: Books, Members, Loans, Authors, BookAuthors, and Fines. 
I created these tables, populated them with sample records, and executed various SQL queries to manage and analyze library operations effectively. 
The case study demonstrates how SQL can be used to streamline processes such as tracking book loans, managing member activities, and calculating fines.

Key Highlights:

Database Design: Developed a relational database schema that supports efficient library operations by interlinking six key tables.

Data Insertion: Carefully inserted meaningful records into the tables to simulate real-world library data.

Query Development:
  Identified the most borrowed books and their genres.
  Analyzed overdue loans and generated fine calculations.
  Explored borrowing trends among members and authors.

Advanced SQL Techniques: 
  Implemented inner/outer joins, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), and aggregate functions for detailed analysis.

Optimization: 
  Enhanced query performance through indexing and normalization of database structure.

Insights: 
  Delivered actionable insights on member engagement, overdue loan trends, and author popularity to improve decision-making in library management.
